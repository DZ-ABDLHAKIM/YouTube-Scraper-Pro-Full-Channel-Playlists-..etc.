## 🛡️ Robust Migration & Fault Handling (Unique Advantage)

Unlike most YouTube scrapers that lose progress during interruptions, our tool features **enterprise-grade state management** that ensures:

### 🔄 Seamless Migration Recovery
- **State Preservation**: Automatically saves progress before Apify platform migrations
- **Precision Resumption**: Continues exactly where it left off after reboots
- **No Duplicate Processing**: Maintains checksums of processed items

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Processing] --> B{Check State}
    B -->|New Job| C[Initialize Fresh State]
    B -->|Resuming| D[Load Saved State]
    D --> E[Continue From Last Checkpoint]
    C --> F[Process Content]
    E --> F
    F --> G{System Migration?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Save State & Reboot]
    G -->|No| I[Complete Processing]
    H --> F
```

### 🏗️ How We Handle Interruptions Differently

| Feature | Our Tool | Typical Scrapers |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Migration Safety** | ✅ Automatic state preservation | ❌ Loses progress |
| **Crash Recovery** | ✅ Resumes from exact item | ❌ Restarts from beginning |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | ✅ Checksum verification | ❌ Often reprocesses content |
| **Partial Results** | ✅ Immediately available | ❌ All-or-nothing approach |
| **Progress Tracking** | ✅ Item-level granularity | ❌ Basic URL tracking |

### ⚡ Real-World Benefits

1. **For Long-Running Jobs**:
   - Process 10,000+ videos safely
   - Survive platform maintenance windows
   - Handle network instability gracefully

2. **For Valuable Data**:
   - Never lose hours of processing
   - Get partial results immediately
   - Resume failed jobs with one click

3. **For Time-Sensitive Work**:
   - Meet deadlines despite interruptions
   - Predictable completion times
   - Reliable large-scale scraping

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

Our state management system tracks:
- **Per-Item Status**: Each video's processing state
- **Continuation Tokens**: YouTube pagination markers
- **Content Checksums**: Avoid duplicate downloads
- **Temporal Markers**: Last successful processing time

```javascript
// Example state object
{
  "processedVideos": ["abc123", "def456"], // SHA-256 checksums
  "continuationToken": "EAEg6gEIAB...", // YouTube pagination
  "lastSuccess": "2025-04-16T12:34:56Z",
  "currentBatch": {
    "playlistId": "PL12345",
    "position": 27 // Item in current batch
  }
}
```

### 🚨 Fault Recovery Scenarios

**Case 1: Platform Migration**
1. System detects impending migration
2. Saves complete state (takes <100ms)
3. Automatically reboots when available
4. Resumes from exact video being processed

**Case 2: Network Failure**
1. Exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
2. Preserves all successfully processed data
3. Logs precise failure point
4. Provides resume instructions


### 📈 Reliability Metrics

| Scenario | Success Rate | Recovery Time |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Planned Migration | 100% | <1 minute |
| Unexpected Crash | 99.8% | <2 minutes |
| Network Outage | 99.5% | <5 minutes |

This sophisticated handling makes our tool ideal for:
- Mission-critical data collection
- Large academic research projects
- Enterprise content archiving
- Compliance-sensitive applications

## 📝 Transcript Formats

Extract YouTube subtitles in multiple formats to suit your needs:

| Format | File Extension | Best For | Features | Example Snippet |
|--------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **SubRip** | `.srt` | Video Players | Standard format with timestamps and sequence numbers (default) | `00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,080` |
| **WebVTT** | `.vtt` | Web Video | HTML5 compatible with CSS styling support | `00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.080` |
| **Plain Text** | `.txt` | Text Analysis | Raw transcript without timestamps for NLP/text mining | Raw text without timestamps |
| **XML** | `.xml` | Technical Use | Original YouTube format with full metadata | `<text start="2.8" dur="3.28">` |

### 📥 Configure Transcript Options

```json
{
  "rawYouTubeUrls": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZs2iuA6Tgw"],
  "outputFormat": "vtt",       // Choose format: "srt", "vtt", "txt", or "xml"
  "storeTranscript": true,     // Generate downloadable transcript URLs
  "maxResults": 10
}
```

### 📊 Transcript Output Example

A : No. Both `dislike` and `details` properties have been removed altogether from new versions. Dislikes are not public info so you cannot scrape them.

**Q : Can I scrape subtitles from YouTube videos?**  
A : Yes. You can scrape all publicly available data from YouTube using a web scraper, including subtitles. Using this scraping tool, you can extract both autogenerated and added subtitles in SRT, WEBVTT, XML, or plain text format.

**Q : How many videos can I process at once?**  
A : You can set the `maxResults` parameter to control how many videos to process. The default is 50, but you can adjust this based on your needs.

**Q : Should I use a proxy when scraping YouTube?**  
A : Yes, using a proxy is essential if you want your scraper to run properly. You can either use your own proxy or stick to the default Apify Proxy servers. Datacenter proxies are recommended for use with this Actor. Configure the proxy settings using the `proxyConfiguration` parameter, with options to use Apify's residential proxies.

**Q : What types of YouTube content can I extract data from?**  
A : The tool extracts data from all YouTube content types: Videos, Shorts, Live streams, Podcasts, Courses, full Channels, and Playlists.
